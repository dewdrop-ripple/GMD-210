King of the Forest

'King of the Forest' is a single-player kingdom builder. It’s slow-paced, and players will spend a lot of time watching their village grow. Players start with some money, food, people, and a small area of cleared land to call home. During the day, they can build as much as they want using their available resources. At night, they must hope their kingdom’s defenses can hold back the raids. Afterwards, their farms and other constructions will produce food, money, and other resources the player can use to continue expanding their kingdom during the upcoming day.

Win the game by reaching a population of 500.


Controls:
-----------------
To destroy a resource or building, click on it while no menus or pop-ups are open.
To build a building, open the build menu, select the building, and click 'buy' (if you have enough resources to buy it). The builing will then follow your mouse until you left-click in an open spot to build. If the spot is not open, it will not work. You can right-click to cancel. 


Cheat Codes:
-----------------
    B - Enable/Disable Cheats. When cheats are enabled, trade is also enabled, regardless of what buildings are currently built.
    N - +25 Food
    M - +25 Money
    K - -25 Food
    L - -25 Money

  The rest of the game is played entirely using the mouse (clicking and dragging). The cheat codes are the only part of the game that uses the keyboard.
